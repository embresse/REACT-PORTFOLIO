# REACT Portfolio

## Description

```m
A React app made with blood, sweat, and many tears but also *love* to showcase a new and improved portfolio with some of the latest technologies. The user is able to navigate to different pages such as an About Me page as well as a Portfolio page to view some of my latest assignments.
```

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Installation

npm i;
